This assignment required me to refactor the coding according to the criteria proposed. 
One of the criteria is that the source code uses semantic HTML tags. 
To meet this criteria I changed the <div> tags into the tags:
<header>
<nav>
<img>
<main>
<section>
<aside>
<footer>
I found that the elements followed a logical structure independent of styling and positioning so I left that as it was.
I added alt attributes to all the images
all the heading attributes fall in sequential order except for the heading found within the <footer> tags so I changed that to an <h4> tag.
I also added a concise and descriptive title based on what I understood from the contents of the website.
